# QTY-dynamics-EAA13
### Abstract
Glutamate transporters play an essential role in neurotransmitter homeostasis, but studying their structure and function is challenging due to their membrane-bound nature. To address this issue, we have developed a simple tool, the QTY code (glutamine, threonine, and tyrosine), for designing hydrophobic domains to become water-soluble without the need for detergents. Previous studies indicated QTY-variants have structurally resembled their native counterparts. However, whether their dynamics and conformational space are affected after QTY-code substitutions has remained unstudied. Molecular dynamics simulations and comparative genomics were used to analyze the structural dynamics of both native transporters and their QTY-variants. Our results demonstrate that QTY-variants exhibit similar residue-wise conformational dynamics to their native counterparts in lipid bilayers, with correlation coefficients of 0.73 and 0.56 for EAA1 and EAA3, respectively. Furthermore, hydrophobic interactions of native helices correlated with water interactions of QTY-helices, suggesting that QTY-variants can mimic aspects of native lipid interactions. Our comparative genomics studies further elucidated conformational flexibility and its relationships with evolutionary conservation. These findings indicate that water-soluble QTY-variants retain key structural and dynamic properties of native glutamate transporters, potentially offering a new approach for studying membrane protein dynamics and drug interactions. This research provides valuable insights into the conformational changes and molecular mechanisms of glutamate transport, which may aid in the development of new therapeutic strategies.
